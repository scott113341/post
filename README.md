## inspiration

`post` is an idea I had when I was home in Colorado.  I was spending time with my grandma and it made me really sad that I couldn't communicate with her easily while I'm away.  She's hard of hearing and doesn't own a computer.  I realized it would be great if I could send her some pictures and letters every once in a while: postcards!

The whole website is powered by [Lob][lob-href], which is an awesome printing API.  It's pretty cheap too: just $0.70 for a 4"x6" postcard and $1.50 for a colossal 6"x11" postcard!  Since `post` uses the Lob API directly, you pay the Lob price and nothing more.  I'm not out to make money with this project.


## technical summary

Some code things used in `post`:

* React + Redux
* [csjs][csjs-href]
* Babel
* Netlify for hosting
* [Waffle.io][waffle-href] for organization
